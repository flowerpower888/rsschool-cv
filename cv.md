## Summary

## Key Skills
- HTML
- CSS, SCSS
- JavaScript
- React, React Native
  - redux/redux-thunk, react-router
- Git
- VS Code

## Code Example
```javascript
function validParentheses(parens){
let result = 0;
  for (let par of parens.split("")) {
    if (par == '(') result += 1;
    else if (par == ')') result -= 1;
    if (result < 0) return false;
  }
  return result == 0
}
```
